# Number-guess
Description
This is a fun two-player number-guessing game.
One person thinks of a secret number, and the other person tries to guess the digits of that number using logic and clues.

👥 Players
Player 1: Chooses a secret number (for example, a 3-digit or 4-digit number).
Player 2: Tries to guess the number digit by digit.

🎮 How the Game Works
Player 1 secretly writes or stores a number.
Player 2 enters a guess.
The program checks:
How many digits are correct.
How many digits are in the correct position.
Based on these clues, Player 2 keeps guessing until the full number is correctly identified.
The game ends when the guess exactly matches the secret number.

🧠 Purpose of the Game
Improves logical thinking and pattern recognition.
Helps players understand how to use clues to narrow down possibilities.
Works similar to games like Mastermind or Bulls and Cows.
